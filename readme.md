# Go Serverless Lambda Skeleton Project

This repository provides a **template** for deploying Go-based AWS Lambda functions using the AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM). The project is designed to be easy to use and customizable for different serverless applications.

## Features
- Automatic creation of the `bootstrap` file for custom runtimes.
- Flexible `Makefile` for building, packaging, deploying, testing, and cleaning up resources.
- Example Lambda function with a customizable event handler.

## Prerequisites
- **[AWS account][aws_account]**
- **[Go][golang]** (version 1.x or later)
- **[AWS CLI][aws_cli]** (configured with your AWS credentials and default region)
- **[AWS SAM CLI][aws_sam]**
- **GNU Make**

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kwtki/go-serverless-lambda.git
   cd go-serverless-lambda
   ```

2. **Build and Deploy:**

   ```bash
   make build
   make deploy
   ```

3. **Test the Lambda Function Manually:**

   Go to the Lambda function's test tab in the AWS Management Console.

   Modify the Event JSON as follows:

   ```json
   {
       "name": "john doe"
   }
   ```

   Run the test and observe the output to ensure it is working as expected.

4. **Test with SAM Locally:**

   You can test your Lambda function locally using SAM CLI with the following command:

   ```bash
   sam local invoke "HelloNameFunction" -e __test__/hello.json
   ```

   This command will invoke the `HelloNameFunction` locally using the event data from `__test__/hello.json`.

5. **Test the Lambda Functions:**
   ```bash
   make test
   ```

   This command will run all tests within the [`functions`](/functions/) directory. It will automatically execute the tests for all Go files ending in `_test.go`.

6. **Clean Up:**

   Delete related commands explained **[here][delete_commands]**

   ```bash
   make delete-all
   ```

   This command will remove the CloudFormation stack, delete the associated S3 bucket, and clean up any IAM roles created during the deployment process.

7. **Delete the CloudFormation Stack Only:**
   ```bash
   make delete-stack
   ```

   If you only want to delete the CloudFormation stack without removing the S3 bucket or IAM roles, use this command.

## Handling Environment Variables
If your Lambda function relies on environment variables, you typically define them in a `.env` file within each function's directory. However, **pushing a `.env` file to your serverless function can expose sensitive information**. 

### **Recommendation:**
For enhanced security, you should use **AWS Secrets Manager** or **AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store** to manage your sensitive environment variables. These services allow you to securely store and access your secrets and configuration data, which can then be retrieved by your Lambda function at runtime.

### Key Points:

- **Automatic Bootstrap Creation:** The `Makefile` handles the creation of the `bootstrap` file needed for custom runtimes, so users don't need to do this manually.
- **Streamlined Clean Up:** The `delete-all` command is simplified to delete the stack and the S3 bucket, excluding IAM role management since it might be handled elsewhere.
- **Test Integration:** The `Makefile` includes a `make test` command to run tests for all functions in the `functions` directory.
